# Project of Control System for a Line Following Robot

This project aims to design a controller for a Line Following Robot, by using a speed feedback control loop of a linearized model for the robot's dynamics. In order to mitigate errors introduced by the linearization, I use speed saturation and gain scheduling for the lateral controller
