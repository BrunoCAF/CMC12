# Project of a Position Servo-Motor with Current Loop

This goal of this project is to design a controller for a position servo-motor, taking into account inner loops effects, filters and delays introduced by discretization. The controller is designed via parameter optimization, and it is discretized via Tustin's method. The effect of the quantization is later evaluated through simulations
